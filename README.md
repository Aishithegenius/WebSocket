# WebSocket Client-Server Communication

This project implements a simple WebSocket-based communication system with both a server and a client. The server listens for incoming WebSocket connections, while the client establishes a connection and exchanges messages with the server in real time.

# Features

- WebSocket Server: Listens for connections and handles bi-directional communication.
- WebSocket Client: Connects to the server and sends/receives messages.
- Real-time messaging: Supports instant data transfer between the client and server.
